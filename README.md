Write to File: Opens a text editor (gedit) for writing or appending content to a selected file.
Analyze File: Provides detailed information about a selected file, including type, access time, owner, inode number, and content statistics.
Execute File: Executes selected executable files (C/C++, Python, Shell, Java, HTML) or opens HTML files in the default browser.
Change File Mode: Allows users to change the permissions (read, write, execute) of a selected file.
Usage
Requirements: Ensure Python is installed on the Linux system.
Execution: Run the script (file_manager.py) using Python.
Interface: Use the buttons to perform desired file management tasks.
