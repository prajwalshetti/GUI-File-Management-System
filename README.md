### GUI File Management System (In Linux)

#### Overview
This Python script implements a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for managing files on a Linux system. It offers various functionalities such as creating, deleting, copying, moving, writing to, analyzing, executing, and changing the mode of files. Users can interact with the system through intuitive buttons and dialogs.

#### Description
This Python script implements a GUI file management system, providing convenient file manipulation options. From creating new files to analyzing existing ones, users can efficiently handle their files without relying solely on command-line operations. The interface simplifies common file tasks and enhances user experience on Linux platforms.

#### Features
1. **Create File**: Allows users to create a new text file and specify the filename and location.
2. **Delete File**: Enables users to delete an existing file from the system.
3. **Open File**: Opens a selected file using the default application associated with its file type.
4. **Copy File**: Copies a file from one location to another, retaining its content and attributes.
5. **Move File**: Moves a file from its current location to a new specified location.
6. **Write to File**: Opens a text editor (gedit) for writing or appending content to a selected file.
7. **Analyze File**: Provides detailed information about a selected file, including type, access time, owner, inode number, and content statistics.
8. **Execute File**: Executes selected executable files (C/C++, Python, Shell, Java, HTML) or opens HTML files in the default browser.
9. **Change File Mode**: Allows users to change the permissions (read, write, execute) of a selected file.

#### Usage
1. **Requirements**: Ensure Python is installed on the Linux system.
2. **Execution**: Run the script (`file_manager.py`) using Python.
3. **Interface**: Use the buttons to perform desired file management tasks.
4. **Dialogs**: Dialog boxes provide additional options and feedback during file operations.
